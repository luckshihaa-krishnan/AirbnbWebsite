## AIRBNB WEBSITE

#### Published URL : https://luckshihaakrishnan-airbnbwebsite.onrender.com/

This is the second project I did in the course which mainly focused on getting started with React.js. In this project, we learned how to create a main navigation, different routes the application can lead to, and dropdowns of different listings/IDs.

This application retrieved data from https://luckshihaakrishnan-apiroutes.onrender.com and the goal was to create an AirBnb webpage using the data. I was able to create dropdowns which contained the name and place of the airbnb as the title, and when clicking on each dropdown, there is a description containing price, ratings, and the summary of the place. This application also contains an about section that introduces myself, the developer, as well as my past experiences and my favourite airbnb I recommend.

My overall goal when creating this application was to make it neat and easy accessible for users viewing this webpage.

The command to run this application is 'npm run dev'. After this command is typed in the terminal, it will give a link to where we can see the application (for example, localhost:3000).
This link would lead us to the application in the browser.
